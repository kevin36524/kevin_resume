\item
\ressubheading{Fault Simulation Acceleration using FPGA based Hardware Emulator} {(Intel Project)}{(July 07 - June 09)}{\hspace{-2 cm}(guide: {\bf{Prof. Madhav P. Desai}})} 
\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{-7pt}
\smalitem{In this approach a given circuit was partitioned into smaller circuits. Each of these partitions were evaluated using a differential algorithm }
\smalitem{Since the fault simulation of a typical VLSI circuit may need several FPGAs, we implemented a multiboard multihost pipelined architecture and evaluated its performance using a performance model}
\smalitem{The performance results were also validated by emulating a few ISCAS Benchmark circuits. The performance results for the same were also compared with our industry standard software fault simulator designed by me }
\end{itemize}

\ressubheading{Exploiting Parallelism \&  Pipelining in {\it A Hardware Intermediate Representation (AHIR)}}{}{(July 2009 onwards)}{\hspace{-1.8 in}(guide: \it{\bf{Prof. Madhav P. Desai}})}
	\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{-7pt}
\smalitem{
AHIR presents a complete flow which starts with an algorithm specified in a highÂ­level programming 
language (such as C) and ends with an RTL description of a circuit that implements the specified 
algorithm. This flow can be applied to a very large class of C programs
}
%	\smalitem{AHIR acts as a compiler that translates hardware descriptions in C to VHDL. But the functionality still remains in series}
\smalitem{ Currently the generated RTL description is not able to exploit parallelism.
My goal is to exploit inherent parallelism and pipelining of hardware and thereby bring the performance of the generated RTL comparable to the hand-crafted RTL }
